h1. titanium-jasmine: testing for Titanium Mobile

h2. About

*titanium-jasmine* is a testing framework for "Appcelerator's Titanium Mobile":http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/ based on "Pivotal's Jasmine":http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/.

h2. How it works

"Titanium Mobile":http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/ translates your hard won JavaScript skills into native applications that perform and look just like they were written in Objective-C (iPhone and iPad) or Java (Android).

"Jasmine":http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ is a "BDD-style":http://behaviour-driven.org framework for JavaScript that makes your tests look awesome:

<pre>describe("titanium-jasmine", function() {
  it("should help you develop titanium applications", function() {
    expect(yourTests).toBe('awesome');
  });
});</pre>

*titanium-jasmine* puts together "Jasmine":http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/ and "Titanium Mobile":http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/, so you can write Jasmine tests that will run inside your iPhone, iPad and Android applications. *titanium-jasmine* is a *really* simple testing framework that will help you test your "Titanium Mobile":http://www.appcelerator.com/products/titanium-mobile-application-development/ applications properly.
